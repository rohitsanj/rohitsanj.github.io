Updates on my Google Summer of Code project -

1. **Use testbook patches to mock objects in Jupyter notebooks**

   You can now use testbook to `patch` objects in the notebook, which is a great step in testability of notebooks. We will be releasing this feature in a future version soon.

2. **Moving PyPI name from `nteract-testbook` to `testbook`**

   We had initially released this project under the name `nteract-testbook` on PyPI since the name `testbook` was already in use by another project which had not been actively developed for quite some time. We reached out to the owner of that project and they generously agreed to transfer the ownership of the project title. We would like to thank them for this!
