Hey there! Welcome to the second blog in the series of GSoC blogs. I'll be writing about the developments made
over the past couple of weeks.

### GitHub Actions

I have successfully set up GitHub actions to do automated testing and code coverage.

### Pull up vs push down

The way testbook was headed initially followed a more **pull up** approach where cell outputs would be "pulled up" from the Jupyter kernel into the unit test upon which assertions will be performed.

However, this was very restricting because non-JSON serializeable objects would not be able to be pulled up. After discussing this with my mentor Matthew Seal, we realized that it would be best to **push down** the assertions instead.

Soon after that, Matt and I had a pair programming session where he suggested some ways in which we could push down the assertions - by creating reference objects that would reference variables/functions in the kernel.

This set me off on the right path and I was able to come up with an implementation that looks something like this:

```python
class TestbookObjectReference:
    def __init__(self, tb, name):
        self.tb: TestbookNotebookClient = tb
        self.name: str = name

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        return TestbookObjectReference(self.tb, f"{self.name}.{name}")

    def __eq__(self, rhs):
        return self.tb._assert_in_notebook(self.name, rhs)

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        code = self.tb._construct_call_code(self.name, args, kwargs)
        return self.tb.value(code)

    def resolve(self):
        return self.tb.value(self.name, safe=False)
```

With this, it would be easy to reference objects in the kernel without needing to pull up their value. 

The main thing in the code above is the `__eq__` method which is what makes assertions happen in the kernel.

#### And now, a simple unit test can be written as follows

```python
from testbook import testbook
import pytest


@pytest.mark.parametrize("a, b, expected", [
    (
        (1, 0), (0, 1), 2 ** 0.5
    ),
    (
        (1, 0), (0, 0), 1
    ),
])
def test_calculate_distance(a, b, expected):
    with testbook('notebook.ipynb', execute=True) as tb:
        calculate_distance = tb.ref("calculate_distance") # returns a reference

        assert calculate_distance(a, b) == expected
```
