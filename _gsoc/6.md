Updates on my Google Summer of Code project -

1. **New PyPI name**

   We have now moved to the PyPI slug `testbook` from `nteract-testbook`.

   ```bash
   pip install testbook
   ```

2. **New blog name**

   We have also obtained the https://testbook.readthedocs.io slug, and moved from "test-book".

3. **`allow_errors` can now be passed**

   Testbook can now execute notebooks by allowing errors ([#54](https://github.com/nteract/testbook/pull/54)).

4. **Testbook now accepts a file object or NotebookNode as argument as well**

   [Accept notebook node as argument #61](https://github.com/nteract/testbook/pull/61)
