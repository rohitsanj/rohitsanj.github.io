title: GSoC Blog 5 - Testbook 0.2.0 release

Updates on my Google Summer of Code project -

1. **Changed the way exceptions are raised**

   In a future release, testbook will support exceptions of all kinds to be raised as `TestbookRuntimeError`.

As the final evaluations come closer, I will try to implement a few experimental features such as calculating code coverage of Jupyter Notebooks. Other than that, we will be releasing testbook 0.2.0 soon and I'm excited for that!
